Bypass the 1min playback restriction in the free version of Plex for iOS
For (obvious) reasons, I won't be providing a packaged version. However, I would like to post the source code for anyone to learn. 

NOTE: This is heavily based on `ajcardwell`'s "Plex - Remove Playback/airplay Limits" Flex3 patch.
